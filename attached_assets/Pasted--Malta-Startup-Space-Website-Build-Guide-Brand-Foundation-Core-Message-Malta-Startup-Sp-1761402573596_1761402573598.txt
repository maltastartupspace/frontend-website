## Final Notes for Developer

**Brand Essence**: This isn't just another coworking site. It's a bridge between an existing thriving online community and an emerging physical space. The copy should honor the community's history while building excitement for what's next.

**Primary Goal**: Get visitors to join the WhatsApp community. Every section should build trust and momentum toward that action.

**Differentiation**: Emphasize Malta-specific advantages authentically. This isn't genericâ€”it's genuinely strategic for European market entry.

**Voice**: Confident founder talking to another founder. Peer-to-peer, not corporate-to-customer.
